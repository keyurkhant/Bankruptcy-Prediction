# Bankruptcy Prediction using Support Vector Machine

## Introduction

Due  to  the  economic  significance  of  bankruptcy  prediction  of  companies  for  financial  institutions,  investors  and  governments,  many  quantitative  methods  have  been  used to develop effective prediction models. Support vector machines (SVM), a powerful classification  method,  has  been  used  for  this  task,  however,  the  performance  of  SVM  is  sensitive  to  model  form,  parameters  setting  and  features  selection.
